### Building with Maven

If you have Maven 3, the Android SDK and an ```ANDROID_HOME``` environment variable, you can simply build with:

    $mvn clean install

This expects an Android device to be attached for running instrumentation tests. Alternatively, use the ```-DskipTests``` option.

### IntelliJ project setup

Import as existing Maven project. Just works.

### Can I skip all this Maven stuff?

Yes. However, you'll need to look at the dependencies in the POMs and go hunting for the dependencies yourself.

### Building with gradle

For building with gradle (checked with gradle v2.2.1), follow these steps:

1. Install the Musicbrainz api jar to local maven repository using

        $ gradle install

2. Now follow one of these in order to build the android application

  1. For building the android apk, installing it to emulator/device and to run instrumentation checks

            $ gradle connectedAndroidTest

  2. For building the android apk and installing it to emulator/device :

            $ gradle installDebug

  3. For building the android apk :

            $ gradle build

3. To clean the build files :

        $ gradle clean

4. Gradle build does not need paypal jar to be installed in local maven repository. But if still one needs to do it, run

        $ gradle publishToMavenLocal
